 NOTES:
 1. Assuming that the script will create the database.
 2. Assuming that we get only integer when needed.
 3. Manual:
 	- navigate to build dir.
 	- run the command: "cmake .."
 	- run the command: "make"
 	- run the script: "./flightScanner.sh"
 	- run the main exe: "./main"

4. code is divided to:
	a. utility shared object.
	b. execution class to execute each command.
	c. func to run the main function, and deals with the processes.
	d. main function.

5. CMake copies the script to build for quicker run.
